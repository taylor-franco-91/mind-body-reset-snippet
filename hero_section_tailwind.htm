      <p class="text-xl text-gray-800 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl mx-auto">Years ago, I felt stuck. Tired, foggy, bloated, and frustrated. I was trying every diet, LITERALLY EVERY ONE! I even went vegan for 6-7 years all to end up gaining weight! I tried every fitness plan, and NOTHING was working or created real change — until I found fasting. That one decision changed everything. I discovered that fasting wasn't about starving — it was about reconnecting with the natural intelligence of my body. I felt clarity. Strength. Peace. And I watched my body transform faster than ever before.</p>
